Deploying a application can require some repetitive work. For example, make all shared libraries available to the the end user can be done using existing tools (like ldd on Linux, or Dependency Walker on Windows). Using those tools helps to see which libraries to provide, but they do not copy them automatically. This is one use case this library can help.
