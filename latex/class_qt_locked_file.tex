The \hyperlink{class_qt_locked_file}{Qt\+Locked\+File} class extends Q\+File with advisory locking functions.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
The \hyperlink{class_qt_locked_file}{Qt\+Locked\+File} class extends Q\+File with advisory locking functions. 

A file may be locked in read or write mode. Multiple instances of {\itshape \hyperlink{class_qt_locked_file}{Qt\+Locked\+File}}, created in multiple processes running on the same machine, may have a file locked in read mode. Exactly one instance may have it locked in write mode. A read and a write lock cannot exist simultaneously on the same file.

The file locks are advisory. This means that nothing prevents another process from manipulating a locked file using Q\+File or file system functions offered by the OS. Serialization is only guaranteed if all processes that access the file use Q\+Locked\+File. Also, while holding a lock on a file, a process must not open the same file again (through any A\+PI), or locks can be unexpectedly lost.

The lock provided by an instance of {\itshape \hyperlink{class_qt_locked_file}{Qt\+Locked\+File}} is released whenever the program terminates. This is true even when the program crashes and no destructors are called.
